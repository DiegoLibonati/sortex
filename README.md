# File Organizer Program

## Educational Purpose

This project was created primarily for **educational and learning purposes**.  
While it is well-structured and could technically be used in production, it is **not intended for commercialization**.  
The main goal is to explore and demonstrate best practices, patterns, and technologies in software development.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Go to the repository folder and execute: `python -m venv venv`
3. Execute in Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
4. Execute in Linux/Mac: `source venv/bin/activate`
5. Execute: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Execute: `pip install -r requirements.dev.txt`
7. Execute: `pip install -r requirements.test.txt`
8. Use `python app.py` or `python -m src` to execute the program

### Pre-Commit for Development

1. Once you're inside the virtual environment, let's install the hooks specified in the pre-commit. Execute: `pre-commit install`
2. Now every time you try to commit, the pre-commit lint will run. If you want to do it manually, you can run the command: `pre-commit run --all-files`

## Description

I made a program that allows to sort the files in a specific path. It will get all the file extensions and create a folder for each extension in that path. Then it will add to each folder the file that corresponds to it. Basically it sorts files depending on the extension. In addition we will be able to choose which extensions to sort or all of them. Filters can also be applied, being able to sort files with a specific size. Finally, if we want to go back we can also do it by clicking on the `Revert ORGANIZE` button, thus returning to the initial state of the path.

## Testing

1. Go to the repository folder
2. Execute: `python -m venv venv`
3. Execute in Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
4. Execute in Linux/Mac: `source venv/bin/activate`
5. Execute: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Execute: `pip install -r requirements.test.txt`
7. Execute: `pytest --log-cli-level=INFO`

## Build

You can generate a standalone executable (`.exe` on Windows, or binary on Linux/Mac) using **PyInstaller**.

### Windows

1. Go to the repository folder
2. Activate your virtual environment: `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Install build dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.build.txt`
4. Create the executable: `pyinstaller app.spec`

Alternatively, you can run the helper script: `build.bat`

### Linux / Mac

1. Go to the repository folder
2. Activate your virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install build dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.build.txt`
4. Create the executable: `pyinstaller app.spec`

Alternatively, you can run the helper script: `./build.sh`

## Security Audit

You can check your dependencies for known vulnerabilities using **pip-audit**.

1. Go to the repository folder
2. Activate your virtual environment
3. Execute: `pip install -r requirements.dev.txt`
4. Execute: `pip-audit -r requirements.txt`

## Env Keys

1. `ENVIRONMENT`: Defines the application environment. Accepts `development`, `production`, or `testing`.

```
ENVIRONMENT=development
```

## Known Issues

None at the moment.
